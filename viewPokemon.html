            <h2>Torchic</h2>
            <p>Torchic sticks with its Trainer, following behind with
                unsteady steps. This Pokémon breathes fire of over 1,800
                degrees Fahrenheit, including fireballs that leave the
                foe scorched black.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Mudkip</h2>
            <p>The fin on Mudkip’s head acts as highly sensitive radar.
                Using this fin to sense movements of water and air,
                this Pokémon can determine what is taking place around
                it without using its eyes.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Treecko</h2>
            <p>Treecko has small hooks on the bottom of its feet that enable
                it to scale vertical walls. This Pokémon attacks by slamming
                foes with its thick tail.</p>
